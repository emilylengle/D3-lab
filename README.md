# D3 Lab
For both of these exercises you will need to run a local server. 
In the command line, navigate to the folder where you have downloaded this repository and type the command below for whichever version of Python you are running:
<ul>
<li>python -m SimpleHTTPServer (for Python 2)</li>
<li>python -m http.server (for Python 3)</li>
</ul>
Don't forget to use your browser developer tools for debugging!

###D3 Beginner Exercise
Start with this exercise.
<ul>
<li>Open the index.html file and follow along with the comments to add the missing code and get the visualization working.</li>
<li>As you go through, try to figure out what is going on with the code. Ask the TAs if you need help.</li>
<li>When you are done (or if you are really stuck!) look at the answer.html file.</li> 
<li>If you get the basic visualization working, you can make your own modifications (add animations and interactivity, change colors, etc.) or move on to the advanced exercise below.</li> 
</ul>
###D3 Advanced Exercise
If you already have some experience in D3 or have completed the beginner exercise. Try your hand at this more advanced exercise.
The original code is from a Spring 2015 assignment by David Eicke.
<ul>
<li>Read through David's code (original-tomodify.csv) and look at the visualization in your browser to get a sense of what is going on in the code.</li>
<li>Implement this code using the billboardtop5.csv data.</li>
<li>Make any necessary changes to the size of the rectangles.</li>
<li>Make any other modifications you like to the animation, colors, etc.</li>
</ul>
